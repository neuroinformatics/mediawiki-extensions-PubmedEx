README FILE FOR xml22 DISTRIBUTION
==================================

Name:    xml22
Version: 0.4.0
Author:  Ingo Schramm (c) 2003
License: GNU GPL (see gnu-gpl.txt)
Web:     http://code.ister.org


Overview
--------

This PHP4 code parses an XML document into a multidimensional
array. The parser recognizes and processes almost all of XML,
including processing instructions, general or external entities and
notations. In addition many functions are provided to search and edit
the document, build a new one and write it back to a string or to a
file. The B<xml22> code is aimed to provide a functionality comparable
to the Document Object Model in a different manner.


Installation
------------

Type this sequence on your Unix/Linux box:

  tar -xzf xml22-0_4_0.tar.gz
  cd xml22-0_4_0
  make install INSTALLDIR=<documentroot/your/php/destination>

If you want to uninstall the files type:

  make uninstall INSTALLDIR=<documentroot/your/php/destination>

If your system is Windows you may use a tool like Winzip to unpack
the archive, then copy all files of the ./xml22 subdirectory to your
prefered destination.

To use xml22 in your own scripts, include the file xml22.inc. If all
you need is the parser, you may include only xml22-parser.inc, which
includes xml22-share.inc via require_once(). If you do not want to
edit XML files, you may omit to include xml22-edit.inc.
