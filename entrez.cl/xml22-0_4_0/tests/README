===========================


Run the tests
-------------

To run the tests you may either point your browser to this directory
which should be accessible by the web server or you run the tests from
the command line. This requires the CGI version of PHP to be
installed.

Try 

	php4 -q testsrch.php -h

or

    php4 -q testedit.php -h

to get information about options.



Run the tests using GNU make
----------------------------

You may use GNU make to run the tests. Simply type

  make test

or to get more output

  make dump

  make profile

  make profile REPEAT=<num>



Note
----

In order to get the proper profiling information for your system, you
should edit "testsrch.php" and "testedit.php" at line 10. The default
value of _SC_CLK_TCK is set to:

  $_SC_CLK_TCK = 100; 

There seems to be no way in PHP to call the POSIX function sysconf()
to get _SC_CLK_TCK dynamically. Set the value to your system's
configuration.
